Here is a list of the most important ones, in my opinion:</p><p><code>vector</code> — provides Vector data type. <a href=\"http://blog.johantibell.com/2011/04/haskell-libraries-you-should-use.html\">Reference</a>: 'Use this package whenever you'd use an array in another language'</p><p><code>unordered-containers</code> — provides HashMap and HashSet data types.</p><p><code>mtl</code> — provides Control.Monad.State, Control.Monad.Reader and others. Crucial for writing stateful code, without them it feels like part of the language is missing.</p><p>These are really the most basic packages and IMHO shouldn't be missing. (How would you feel about exclusion of std::vector from C++?) It would be great if at least these packages were installed but it's really simpler to just install Haskell Platform.</p></div>",

      "text": "<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Hello, can you please consider increasing the stack size limit for Ruby? I have been practicing the language recently, and realized that the language has a 1MiB stack size limit by default. This limit makes a lot of things impossible for the language in CP (i.e. it dies here and there due to SystemStackError). This issue has been existent on other online judges as well, and I hope to see a resolution to this issue on Codeforces (and other judges as well). The language is mostly great (The ability to write concise code is a good thing in CP after all), and I hope other people could enjoy the language in CP as well. Still, this change may be crucial for people to truly enjoy the experience, without too many frustrations. (I won't complain about the language being too slow, sacrificing speed for conciseness is a good deal)</p><p>UPD: An update to Ruby 3.1.0 (or higher) would be a good change as well!</p></div>",
